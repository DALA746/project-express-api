# Express API Project

This week project I started my backend journey by creating an API using Express. This API have RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

## What I learned

- How to install and setup an Express server.
- How to deploy Node projects.
- How to build an API in Node using Express
- How to create routes in Express
- Practice data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays
