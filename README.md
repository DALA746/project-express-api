# Express API Project

This project developed during my time at technigo boot camp. During development, I gained an insight into how the backend works and created my first API. In this latest update, I added a search function with the possibility to search by title.

## What did I learn during this backend journey?

- How to set install och set up an Express server.
- How to deploy Node projects. I am using Railway free plan.
- How to build an API in Node using Express.js
- Data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays.

I also created a frontend project just for the demonstration of this API. You can find it in the link below.
